# YOUR PROJECT TITLE
    #### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
    #### Description: The project aims to delve into the world of data analysis, since it is a developing area for both future career options as well as individuals' interests.
    Thus, the project will try to output interesting graphics related, like a word cloud, to movies, since it is another area I am interested in.

If unfamiliar with Markdown syntax, you might find GitHub’s Basic Writing and Formatting Syntax helpful. If you are using the CS50 Codespace, you can also preview your .md file by clicking the ‘preview’ icon as explained here: Markdown Preview in vscode. Standard software project READMEs can often run into the thousands or tens of thousands of words in length; yours need not be that long, but should at least be several hundred words that describe things in detail!

Your README.md file should be minimally multiple paragraphs in length, and should explain what your project is, what each of the files you wrote for the project contains and does, and if you debated certain design choices, explaining why you made them. Ensure you allocate sufficient time and energy to writing a README.md that documents your project thoroughly. Be proud of it! If it is too short, the system will reject it.
